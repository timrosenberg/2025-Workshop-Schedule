        <h2>üóìÔ∏è Schedule & Activities</h2>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Where can I find the most up-to-date daily schedule?</summary>
                <p>Easy peasy! The full schedule with times and locations for all activities is <a href="https://timrosenberg.github.io/2025-Workshop-Schedule">right here</a>. Bookmark it on your phone!</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do I really have to go to everything on the schedule?</summary>
                <p>Yes, you're expected to be at all events like rehearsals, classes, and performances that are on the schedule. If something totally unexpected comes up, you need to be excused by Dr. Rosenberg.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>When will I find out my chamber ensemble assignment?</summary>
                <p>Your chamber ensemble assignment will be given to you at check-in; so, you probably already have it. If you are not sure what your chamber ensemble is, ask a faculty member.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What if I have a question about where I'm supposed to be or what's next on the schedule?</summary>
                <p>No problem! Remember, the schedule is <a href="https://timrosenberg.github.io/2025-Workshop-Schedule">right here</a>; so, you can always see what's next. But, if your phone dies or something, any of the Workshop faculty can tell you what's next or help you figure out where you need to be. Just ask!</p>
            </details>

        <h2>üè´ Workshop Rules & Campus Life</h2>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can I leave the Stetson campus to grab food or hang out with friends?</summary>
                <p>üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Nope! To make sure everyone is safe, students are not allowed to leave the Stetson campus during the workshop. This includes going out to eat, even with family or friends who might be nearby.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What's the deal with using my phone or other electronic devices during workshop activities?</summary>
                <p>During any rehearsals or concerts, please set your phone and other devices to "Do Not Disturb" or turn them completely off. You can totally use them in between scheduled activities, though!</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What are the rules about having friends in my dorm room?</summary>
                <p>For everyone's comfort and safety, members of the opposite gender aren't allowed in each other's dorm rooms.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Uh oh, I think I lost my room key/FOB! What do I do?</summary>
                <p>Okay, don't panic, but let a faculty member know ASAP. Just so you're aware, there's a $75 charge for a lost FOB (that's the electronic key) and a $75 charge for a lost regular dorm room key. But, we're going to try to help you find it before it comes to that.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is something that would get me immediately kicked out?</summary>
                <p>Things like smoking, posessing or consuming alcoholic beverages, any other kind of chemical abuse, posessing firearms, or posessing fireworks are a strict no-go and are not allowed under any circumstances. If this rule is broken, the student will be dismissed from the workshop right away, and it would be at the student's family's expense. Let's not do anything stupid and all focus on making amazing music and having a fun, safe week!</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What if I'm not feeling well or have a medical issue during the workshop?</summary>
                <p>Please tell a faculty member immediately. If you can't tell us yourself, ask someone else to do it (roommate, friend, have a family member call us, etc.). You can text or call Dr. Rosenberg at <a href="sms:+14074940603">(407) 494-0603</a>. Serious medical emergencies will be handled through West Volusia Memorial Hospital here in DeLand.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>I auditioned for the Young Artist Honors Recital. How do I know if I'm in the final round, and what happens then?</summary>
                <p>You would have been notified <em>before</em> the first day of the workshop if you moved on to the final round. (If you were not notified, you did not advance to the final round.) If you were selected, your final audition happens on the first day of the workshop, shortly after check-in.</p>
            </details>

             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can family and/or friends attend the concerts?</summary>
                <p>Yes! Family and friends are welcome and encouraged to attend the concerts on Thursday (Young Artist Honors Concert), Friday (Chamber Ensembles), and Saturday (Large Ensembles). The recitals on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are exclusively for the Workshop students (that's you!).</p>
